The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm is derived from Bayes' theorem, which provides a framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence. Here's how the derivation proceeds:

1. Bayes' theorem is applied to image restoration:

$$
P(f(x)|g(x)) = \frac{P(g(x)|f(x))P(f(x))}{P(g(x))}
$$

Where f(x) is the true image and g(x) is the observed blurred image[^2].

2. The likelihood P(g(x)|f(x)) is modeled using a Poisson distribution, which is appropriate for image noise:

$$
P(g(x)|f(x)) = \prod_{x} \frac{(f(x) \otimes h(x))^{g(x)} e^{-(f(x) \otimes h(x))}}{g(x)!}
$$

Where h(x) is the point spread function (PSF)[^2].

3. The negative log-likelihood is then minimized:

$$
L(f(x)) = \sum_{x} (f(x) \otimes h(x) - g(x) \ln(f(x) \otimes h(x)))
$$

4. Through a series of mathematical manipulations and approximations, including Taylor expansion and convolution properties, the update rule is derived:

$$
f^{n+1} = \left(\frac{g(x)}{f^n \otimes h(x)} \otimes h\right) f^n
$$

This iterative update rule forms the core of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm[^2].

By deriving the algorithm from Bayes' theorem, it inherently incorporates prior knowledge about the image formation process and noise characteristics, leading to a statistically motivated approach for image deblurring[^1][^2].

The query appears to be a mix of mathematical notation and text, which makes it difficult to interpret clearly. However, I can explain the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, which seems to be the main topic of interest based on the query and search results.

The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm is an iterative deconvolution method used to restore blurred images, particularly in contexts where Poisson noise is present[^1][^3]. It works by minimizing a convex loss function to reconstruct the original image from a blurred and noisy version[^1].

The algorithm proceeds in phases:

1. Initialization: Start with an initial estimate of the true image.
2. Forward model: Convolve the current estimate with the known Point Spread Function (PSF)[^1].
3. Comparison: Compare the result to the observed blurred image.
4. Update: Adjust the estimate based on the comparison.
5. Iteration: Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence.

The core equation for updating the image estimate in each iteration is:

$$
o_{k+1}(s) = \left\{\left[\frac{i(s)}{(o_k * h)(s)}\right] * h(-s)\right\} o_k(s)
$$

Where:

- $$
o_k
$$ is the current image estimate
- $$
i
$$ is the observed blurred image
- $$
h
$$ is the PSF
- $$
*
$$ denotes convolution[^2]

This process reassigns image intensity by iteratively refining the estimate, effectively deblurring the image while accounting for Poisson noise[^1][^3].

The algorithm can be extended with additional features:

1. Total Variation Regularization: Helps prevent noise amplification[^2][^3].
2. Vector Acceleration: Speeds up convergence[^2].
3. Non-Circulant Edge Handling: Reduces boundary artifacts[^2].

These extensions modify the update equation to improve the deconvolution results in various ways, such as noise reduction and faster convergence[^2][^3].
